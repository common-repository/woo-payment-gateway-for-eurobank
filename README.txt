Since version 2.0 we have removed a lot of old code, this also includes some code that made the application backward compatible
with 10+ year old versions of WordPress. The cleaned up codebase has been thoroughly tested with WordPress 6.4.2 and
WooCommerce 8.5.0. It's probably safe to assume that it works in most of the "recent" releases of both WooCommerce and WordPress,
but not versions from 10+ years ago.
